Welcome to my personal webpage! I am a senior economist in [De Nederlandsche Bank's](https://www.dnb.nl/en/) monetary policy department. I am also affiliated with the [University of Amsterdam's School of Economics](https://ase.uva.nl/) as a PhD student. 

I was recently seconded to the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/)'s Monetary Analysis Division, and hold a MSc degree in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from [the LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk) and a BA in Economics with Mathematics and Politics from [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu).

My research interests are in empirical macroeconomics, monetary policy and financial intermediation.
